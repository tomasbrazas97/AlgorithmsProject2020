MD5 Hash Generator <br>
MAIN DOCUMENTATION IS IN **overview.md**

This is my repository that consists my take on the MD5 Hash Generator. The application takes in an input string<br>
specified by the user and then it is encoded into a 128-bit fingerprint using the MD5 algorithm. Encoding the<br>
same string will result in the same hash output. This is not an encryption but rather than a fingerprint of the input.<br>
It's one-way, almost impossible to backtrack and retrieve the original string from MD5 hash.
